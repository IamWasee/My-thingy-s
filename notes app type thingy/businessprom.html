            <h2>Chapter Questions and Answers</h2>
            
            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">1. What is meant by sponsorship?</div>
                <div class="answer">Sponsorship is where a business attracts publicity by
                    linking the name of the company, or a product, to a major
                    event. In return for a fee, a business is allowed to advertise
                    in key positions around an event. In this case, the Chinese
                    company Vivo Electronics became the title sponsor of the
                    IPL in 2016. Therefore the league is officially known as the
                    Vivo Indian Premier League.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">2. Describe two advantages to sponsors of their
                    involvement in the IPL.</div>
                <div class="answer">One of the key advantages of sponsorship is that the name
                    of the brand can be projected globally via television without
                    paying broadcasters. This is because most of the major
                    events targeted by sponsors are televised. Therefore it is
                    a cheap way to get television coverage. Major sporting
                    events, such as the Indian Premier League, are popular with
                    sponsors because the reach to television viewers can be
                    global. Each sponsor is given advertising boards around
                    the edges of the cricket pitch. These images are displayed
                    regularly by television cameras while a match is in progress.
                    Sponsors of the IPL, such as Vodafone, Yes Bank, CEAT
                    Tyres, Tata Sky, Coca-Cola, Amazon and OPPO, also get
                    their logos displayed during pre- and post-match interviews
                    and free tickets to each match. They also likely to get
                    priority on television adverts during matches to give them
                    maximum exposure..</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">3. What is meant by viral advertising? Use an example
                    from this case study in your explanation.</div>
                <div class="answer">Viral advertising involves any strategy that encourages
                    people to pass on messages to others about a product
                    or a business electronically. It creates the potential for
                    exponential growth in the exposure of a message. Like
                    a virus, these strategies exploit the process of rapid
                    multiplication that results from people sending messages
                    to family, friends and colleagues, who then send them
                    on again. Not only can people send text relating to a
                    marketing message, but they can also send images, such
                    as photographs and video clips. In this case, an advert
                    by smartphone maker Reliance Retail went viral on social
                    media. It featured Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut and
                    the cricketers M.S. Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Ravichandran
                    Ashwin.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">4. Discuss one benefit to businesses of establishing a
                    brand name.</div>
                <div class="answer">The aim of many businesses is to build a powerful brand.
                    Branding involves giving a product a name, term, sign, symbol, design or any feature that allows consumers to
                    instantly recognise the product and differentiate it from
                    those of competitors. Some brand names are very well
                    known and worth a great deal of money. In this case,
                    the IPL brand was said to be worth US$4500 million in
                    2015. Branding can be used to differentiate the product,
                    create customer loyalty, help recognition and develop an
                    image. In this case, the IPL brand helps recognition and
                    allows the IPL to charge higher rates for sponsorship and
                    broadcasting rights. All cricket supporters and most people
                    in the sub-continent are likely to be aware of the brand.
                    This means that businesses can project their adverts to
                    larger audiences if they are linked to the IPL in some way.
                    However, they have to pay more to receive these benefits.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-item">
                <div class="question">5. Assess the benefits to a business of using social media
                    in advertising.</div>
                <div class="answer">The use of social media platforms, such as Facebook,
                    Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr, in advertising is growing at
                    a rapid rate. In 2015, the Internet had 3170 million users.
                    There are 2300 million active social media users and 91
                    per cent of retail brands use two or more social media
                    channels. Internet users have an average of 5.54 social
                    media accounts and social media users have risen by 176
                    million in the last year.
                    Social networks gather lots of information about users,
                    which allows businesses to target their adverts more
                    effectively. When people use the Internet, every click,
                    every view and every sign-up is recorded somewhere. This
                    behaviour is collected, processed and eventually ends up
                    with businesses.
                    In this case, the IPL generates an enormous amount of
                    social media activity. The 2016 Twenty20 saw close to 9
                    million Tweets, an increase of 122 per cent in Tweets-permatch from 2015. The official IPL website has a ‘Social’ tab
                    which captures all online conversations including a leader
                    board for Tweets and mentions related to the tournament
                    and each IPL team.
                    One of the main advantages of using social media in
                    advertising is cost: it is easy and inexpensive relative to
                    other methods of advertising. Another key benefit is that
                    adverts can be targeted. This means that businesses
                    will direct their promotions, offers and other marketing
                    information only to those people who are likely to be
                    interested. As a result, there is much less waste in
                    advertising. Businesses can also respond immediately to
                    developments in the industry and the quality of customer
                    service can be improved because it is possible to
                    communicate instantly with customers. Another big benefit
                    is the ability to reach huge audiences – hundreds of millions
                    or even billions. Finally, links can be used by businesses
                    to draw traffic into company websites. This should help to
                    increase sales.
                    The importance of social media to advertisers cannot be
                    overemphasised. Figure 39.6 shows that the amount spent
                    by businesses on digital advertising is about to overtake
                    that spent on television advertising. It seems that the use of
                    social media in marketing is here to stay</div>
