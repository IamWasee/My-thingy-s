        <h1>Physics Notes: Motion in the Universe & Stellar Evolution</h1>
        
        <h2>Chapter 26: Motion in the Universe</h2>
        <p>The universe is governed by forces such as <span class="highlight">gravity</span>, which affects the motion of celestial bodies.</p>
        
        <h3>The Solar System</h3>
        <p>The <span class="highlight">planets orbit the Sun</span> in elliptical paths. This motion is governed by <span class="highlight">gravitational forces</span>, which depend on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="highlight">masses</span> of the objects.</li>
            <li>The <span class="highlight">distance</span> between them.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Orbital Motion</h3>
        <p>Objects move in circular orbits due to a continuous force pulling them inward. For example, satellites orbit Earth because of gravity.</p>
        
        <h3>Comets</h3>
        <p>Comets have highly elliptical orbits and move fastest when they are closest to the Sun due to increased gravitational force.</p>
        
        <h3>Gravitational Field Strength</h3>
        <p>The force of gravity is measured in <span class="highlight">N/kg</span>. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Earth: <span class="important">10 N/kg</span></li>
            <li>Moon: <span class="important">1.6 N/kg</span> (so you weigh six times less!)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Chapter 26 Questions & Answers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>What is the name of the force that keeps planets in orbit around the Sun?</b><br> Answer: Gravitational force.</li>
            <li><b>What two factors determine the strength of this force on a planet's surface?</b><br> Answer: The mass of the planet and the distance from the Sun.</li>
            <li><b>Describe the differences between the orbits of a moon, a planet, and a comet.</b><br> Answer: Moons orbit planets in nearly circular paths, planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths, and comets have highly elongated orbits.</li>
            <li><b>Calculate the speed of a satellite orbiting 200 km above Earth with a period of 1 h 24 min.</b><br> Answer: Using the orbital speed formula, v = 2πr / T, the speed is approximately 8.2 km/s.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Chapter 27: Stellar Evolution</h2>
        <p>Stars evolve over time, undergoing significant changes throughout their lifespan.</p>
        
        <h3>Formation of Stars</h3>
        <p>Stars form from vast clouds of gas and dust called <span class="highlight">nebulae</span>. Gravity pulls material together, increasing pressure until <span class="highlight">nuclear fusion</span> begins.</p>
        
        <h3>Main Sequence Stars</h3>
        <p>Once fusion starts, a star enters the <span class="highlight">main sequence</span> phase, where gravitational pull and outward pressure from fusion are balanced.</p>
        
        <h3>End of a Star’s Life</h3>
        <p>When hydrogen runs out:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important">Small stars</span> (like our Sun) expand into <span class="highlight">red giants</span> and eventually become <span class="highlight">white dwarfs</span>.</li>
            <li><span class="important">Massive stars</span> become <span class="highlight">supergiants</span>, undergo a <span class="highlight">supernova</span>, and may leave behind <span class="highlight">neutron stars</span> or <span class="highlight">black holes</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram</h3>
        <p>This diagram plots <span class="highlight">temperature</span> against <span class="highlight">luminosity</span>, helping classify stars into main sequence, red giants, white dwarfs, etc.</p>
        
        <h3>Chapter 27 Questions & Answers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Describe the process of star formation from a nebula.</b><br> Answer: Stars form from nebulae, where gravity pulls gas and dust together until nuclear fusion begins.</li>
            <li><b>What happens to a star when its hydrogen fuel is depleted?</b><br> Answer: It expands into a red giant or supergiant, and later evolves into a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole depending on its mass.</li>
            <li><b>Explain the difference in the fate of low-mass stars and massive stars.</b><br> Answer: Low-mass stars become white dwarfs, while massive stars undergo supernova explosions and may form neutron stars or black holes.</li>
            <li><b>What does the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram tell us about stellar evolution?</b><br> Answer: It classifies stars by temperature and luminosity, showing their evolutionary stages.</li>
